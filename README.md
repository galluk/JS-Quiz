## User Story
<p>
Having been given a small video of a similar quiz app in action, we were required to repoduce it using our acquired skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The requirement involved asking 5 multiple choice questions on JavaScript, with the user selecting one of 4 possible answers. The quiz timer begins at 100 seconds and counts down until all questions are completed or the timer gets to 0. An incorrect answer reduces the time remaing by 10 seconds.
